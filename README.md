<strong><u>Part 1:  Programming the MSP432 board</u> </strong>

Attach the Ultrasonic sensor as shown in the Feb 23 notes.

Also in the notes were a demonstration of how to measure several numbers and take the best value.  In this assignment you are to take the median value of readings.  Take five readings, one a second.  During one of the readings put your hand very close to the sensor to get a very small (and erroneous) reading.  Then print out the median, wait 5 seconds, and do it again.  You only need to show the setup once at the beginning, then the screen while running two cycles.

The video you record should be no more than 30 seconds, and should capture the screen showing five measurements and the outputted best value.  An example on the screen would be (in the Serial Monitor window):

Distance = 20 centimeter

Distance = 20 centimeter

Distance = 20 centimeter

Distance = 10 centimeter

Distance = 20 centimeter

Median distance = 20 centimeter

Distance = 21 centimeter Distance = 5 centimeter

Distance = 21 centimeter

Distance = 22 centimeter

Distance = 20 centimeter

Median distance = 21 centimeter
